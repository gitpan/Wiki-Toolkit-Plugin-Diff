0.07  Sat Jun 26 2004
    - Fixed Dom's problem with trailing newlines, or rather the

      and intradiff.

0.06  Sat May 15 2004
    - Looked at Earle's "false positive" problem with word matching
    - Made internal method calls visible, hence subclassable
    - changed to use Params::Validate for validation

0.05  Thu Dec 18 2003
    - Corrected another bug in the diffing. Was not correctly
      handling words that did not have an immediately following space.

0.04  Thu Dec 18 2003
    - Use VCS::Lite::Delta->hunks method call instead of 
      breaking encapsulation (needs VCS::Lite 0.05)
    - Allow selection of metadata variables
    - Fix a bug with <BR /> tags not being handled

0.03  Sun Dec 07 2003
    - Fix sort order for multiple metadata entries. This was
